Are Customers in Austin Opting for Smaller, More Frequent Purchases?


## Background Context

The dashboards provide a clear overview of sales metrics, trends, and insights to support data-driven decision-making. The data is collected from October 2024 to February 2025.

Key Performance Indicators:
* Average Transaction Value (ATV): average spend per transaction
